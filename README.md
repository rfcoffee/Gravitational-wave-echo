# Gravitational-wave-echo
Gravitational wave echoes from black holes in massive gravity

This project aims at computing the gravitational wave time strain from black holes in massive gravity. The project comprises two parts. Part 1 deal with solving the partial differential equatial (Regge-Wheeler equation) using Laplace transformation method. This is done is Mathematica. Part 2 deals with visualizing data and extracting the quasinormal mode from time series.
